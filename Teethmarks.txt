Teethmarks

<1st verse>
When all the things I should have said,
Are rattling around my head,
I remember what you said instead,
About teethmarks

The greatest retorts in the world,
And I’m sorry if this sounds absurd,
But sadly they remain unheard,
I got teethmarks,

<1st chorus>
And you said teethmarks,
In your tongue,
They don’t suit you,
I know,
You’re not wrong,
I’m still mute though,

<2nd verse>
So how did this come to pass?
I really should have kicked his ass,
My glory days were full of sass,
Without teethmarks

I guess I had too much to lose,
I ended up feeling abused,
The tolerance I tried to prove,
Left teethmarks

<2nd chorus>
And I say teethmarks,
In my tongue,
They don’t suit me,
Time now, to move on,
Like it’s easy.

<3rd verse>
If you find your tongue is tied,
After everything you’ve tried,
My advice is go outside,
With those teethmarks.

Run around and scream and shout,
Let the stress and tension out,
Don’t go back, without a doubt,
To those teethmarks.

<Ending>
‘Cause teethmarks, serve, no, one!
