Under the Waves

(this one needs some music.  I was narked when this popped into my head, but I hadn't done any music theory back then, so could only write down the words, not the tune. Feel free to write a new one).

(verse 1)
Feel the neoprene on your skin,
  As the water seeps in,
The rubber on your face,
  As the mask slides into place,
Slip the reg into your mouth,
  Spit the water out,
Take a breath and check your air,
  It's time to go down there.

(chorus)
We're on a wavelength, 
  Underneath the waves,
If it weren't for the air,
  We could stay here for days,
Watching the fish,
  As they swim through our hair,
Unlike above,
  Down here are no cares.

(verse 2)
Thoughts drift in and out my head,
  As we reach the seabed,
Get the bouyancy control,
  Submerged, yet floating is our goal,
And I feel a strange new calm,
  Is this narcosis?
Or maybe just,
  A prelude to psychosis.

(verse 3)
As we ascend once more,
  To reach the surface, boat and shore,
Will we still feel as we do?
  Scuba lovers two,
Cast my perspex filtered gaze,
  Through the underwater haze,
You signal 'ok' and hold my hand,
  It'll all be fine on dry land.
