(verse 1)
We dance this dance but not too close,
As then I'd have to let you lead,
And if you knew me better that is,
Not something you'd ask of me.

We're back here at the crossroads,
Not quite friends yet neither enemies,
The gap between us tells a tale,
Showing where the trust should be.

(chorus)
If I'd shown more courage,
When I first found out your name,
Would it have turned out different,
Would we still be the same?

I've got a friend, he'd say,
"It wasn't meant to be",
Time to let it go,
Far better of just being free

(verse2)
Can you fit in one last dance?
Do we have the time,
I could try to hold your gaze,
As the clock begins to chime,

Maybe I would ask you,
If I could find the words,
But every combination somehow,
Sounded too absurd.

(last chorus)
If I'd shown more courage,
When I first found out your name,
Would it have turned out different,
Would we still be the same?

I've got a friend, he'd say,
"It wasn't meant to be",
Time to let it go,
Far better off just being free,

I've got a friend, he'd say,
"It wasn't meant to be"
Time to let it go,
Far better off just being me.
