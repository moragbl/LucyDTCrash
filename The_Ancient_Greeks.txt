The ancient Greeks of Old,
  Didn't need to be told,
For they had this love thang all worked out,
There are many types you see,
  Of love between thee and me,
And that is what this song is all about.

Agape is oh so pure,
  How does this love endure?
For this is giving without any take,
With your best interests at heart,
  Selfless from the very start,
This kind of love can make the whole world sing.

If balance is your thing,
  Why not give philia a swing?
A virtous and loyal equality,
So I'll be good to you,
  If you're good to me too,
A comfortable familiarity.

After many years together,
  Pragma's the way to weather,
Love's long and sometimes bumpy road,
Longstanding and mature,
  Patient compromise ensures,
Affection continues as you go.

This one may cause contention,
  But philautia gets a mention,
Self love is not just flying solo,
Taking care of yourself,
  Is important for your health,
Just be wary of narcissim.

Now me, I like to flirt,
  A little ludos doesn't hurt,
It's fine if we're playing the same game,
It makes us all feel good,
  When the rules are understood,
If not it causes unintended pain.

Eros is the one,
  Where two people get it on,
A passion that is physical and strong,
It reminds me of my youth,
  But it's anytime in truth,
That the lust scoops up and sweeps you both along.

That's all I have to tell,
  You know love can be swell,
It can also make you vulnerable and sore,
Just remember to be kind,
  Be more open, less refined,
And like the Greeks keep your heart open for more.
