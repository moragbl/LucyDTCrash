The Loser Edit

The loser edit, 
There I've said it,
Looking back with regret,
Highlight each uncertain step,
Convinced you could do naught but fail,
Beneath that gaze hope will pale,

But wait, 
We each write our own story,
Combine each tale, 
O' despair and glory,
Gather all our lows and highs,
Set forth under uncertain skys,

It isn't over,
When it starts,
Every step,
Can change our hearts,
The times we lose, the times we find,
The things we gain or leave behind,

So view again,
The cutting room floor,
Mind what you,
Forgot afore,
Keep that balance in your sight,
And mind the wrongs outweighed by right.
